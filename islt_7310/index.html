    <p><h2>About the Site</h2></p>
    <p>Judicial Review is an important concept to understand when looking at the US Government.  It is through this process that the Judicial Branch can check the Legislative and Executive branches of the government.  Judicial Review can also help to clarify rights granted to citizens and set precedent for lower courts.  The purpose of this website is to give students a way to learn about important US Supreme Court cases.  The website will give basic information about 20 important court cases.  Students will work to identify the question being decided in the case.  Students will also look at the decision the Supreme Court made.  Second students will look to categorize the court cases by which amendment they relate to.  The last objective is students will be able to take a real-life scenario and apply it to the correct court case that set up the precedent involved.  After reading through this website students will have a better grasp of Landmark US Supreme Court cases and their impact on the United States.</p>
