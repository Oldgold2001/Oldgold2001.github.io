                <h2><em>Marbury v. Madison</em></h2>                 
                <p>Judicial Review is a process that is not officially defined in the US Constitution.  However, it is an important part of the checks and balance system we have in our government.  Through Judicial Review the courts can check the power of the Legislative and Executive branch of the United States government.  By making decisions on questions brought before the Supreme Court they can declare a law or act to be unconstitutional or further clarify the interpretation of how the law should be applied to the citizens of the country.  Judicial Review was originally set up in the court case Marbury v. Madison in 1803.</p>
                <p>For more information about <em>Marbury v Madison</em> read the article linked below and then watch the video.</p>

                <h2>11 Landmark Cases</h2>
                <p>There are many court cases that are decided on every year.  For the purposes of this website, we will focus on 11 Landmark US Supreme Court cases selected by the American Bar Association.  Students will learn about the issue of the case and what caused it to be heard by the Supreme Court.  This is often called the question of the case.  Students will learn about the basic facts of the case as well as the decision.  Next the students will go to the oyez.com website to research the cases further.  By looking at this website students will be able to see the majority, concurring, or dissenting opinion for each of the 11 cases.</p>

               <h2>How do the Justices decide?</h2>
                <p>The next step in understanding the court cases is looking at the amendments they are based upon.  The question of each case is based off an amendment or article of the US Constitution.  The Supreme Court justices will look at the Constitution and decide based on how they interpret the Constitution.  By matching the Landmark Court Cases up with the appropriate article or amendment it will allow the students to see the connection between the case and the Constitution.</p>
