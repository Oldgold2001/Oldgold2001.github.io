<h3>Supervisor Skilled Technical Sciences</h3>
<p>Greetings! I am Linda Stinson and I live in New London, MO. I work for the <em>Missouri</em> Department <br/>of Elementary and Secondary Education in Jefferson City, MO through the Office of College and Career Readiness. My position is a supervisor for the Skilled Technical Sciences department, which I have really enjoyed for the past two years.

My previous experience includes teaching <em>Family</em> Consumer Science for 14.5 years, serving as a Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) and <strong>ProStart</strong> advisor. I left the classroom for a change and desire to help other educators.

I am currently pursuing my Education Specialist Degree in Learning Technologies and Design from the University of Missouri School of Information Science and Learning Technologies. I plan to graduate in May of 2022. My goal is to receive my doctorate degree. I look forward to the opportunities that await with my pursuit of higher education.</p>
