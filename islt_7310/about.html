                <p>Hello, I am Joshua Dorr and welcome to my page. I graduated from high school in 1996 from Centralia High School in Centralia, MO. Following high school, I attended the University of Missouri – Columbia and graduated in May of 2001 with a Bachelor of Science in Education with an emphasis in Secondary Social Studies.  In 2006 I received my Masters in Educational Administration from Williams Woods University.  Currently, I am working toward my Educational Specialist degree from the University of Missouri - Columbia with an emphasis in Learning Technologies and Development.<br/><br/> I have taught a variety of Social Studies courses over my 20-year career, including US Government for the past 6 years.  The last 4 years at my current school I have helped develop and implement the Virtual US Government course.  I have been involved in the formulating of activities and materials to teach the US Government curriculum through and online platform.</p></div>

            <div class="item2">I also coach basketball which takes a lot of time during the winter and summer. When I am not teaching or coaching I enjoy spending time with my wife and two children. My family enjoys exploring around the Kansas City area and we are always looking for a new park or restaurant.  I also like to get outside the city when I can.  I have had the opportunity to travel to over 40 states in the U.S. as well as France, the United Kingdom, and Southeast Asia.
