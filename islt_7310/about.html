    <p>I graduated from high school in 1996 from Centralia High School in Centralia, MO.  Following high school, I attended the University of Missouri – Columbia and graduated in May of 2001 with a Bachelor of Science in Education with an emphasis in Secondary Social Studies.  In 2006 I received my Masters in Educational Administration from Williams Woods University.  Currently, I am working toward my Educational Specialist degree from the University of Missouri - Columbia with an emphasis in Learning Technologies and Development.<br/><br/> I have taught a variety of Social Studies courses over my 20-year career, including US Government for the past 6 years.  The last 4 years at my current school I have helped develop and implement the Virtual US Government course.  I have been involved in the formulating of activities and materials to teach the US Government curriculum through and online platform.</p>
